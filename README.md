# twisty.js

A javascript library for twistypuzzles.

Started by [Lucas Garron](https://www.garron.net/), July 2011. Includes work from [Jeremy Fleischman](https://github.com/jfly).


## Inspiration
- [Ryan Heise](http://www.ryanheise.com/)'s revolutionary [Rubik's Cube Simulator](http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html) with keyboard input.
- [Werner Randelshofer](http://randelshofer.ch/)'s highly configurable [virtual cubes](http://randelshofer.ch/rubik/index.html)
- [Josef Jelinek](http://rubikscube.info/)'s simple and configurable [AnimCube](http://software.rubikscube.info/AnimCube/) (with some credit to [Karl Hornell](http://www.javaonthebrain.com/java/rubik/) and [Lars Petrus](http://lar5.com/cube/)).
- [Michiel van der Blonk](http://www.vanderblonk.com/)'s (?) [FMC helper page](http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp)
